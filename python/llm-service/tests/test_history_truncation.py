"""Tests for tool-type-aware history truncation in build_agent_messages.

Root cause: HISTORY_RESULT_MAX = 2000 truncates ALL tool results uniformly.
file_read results (agent's working memory) get destroyed between iterations,
forcing agents to waste 9 of 15 iterations re-reading the same file.

Fix: file_read/file_edit results should preserve much more content (15K),
while web_search/web_fetch keep moderate truncation (3000).
